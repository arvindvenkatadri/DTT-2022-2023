## Introduction

Oh my what a rollercoaster were these 2 weeks were, lots of suffering and internal pain, the course made me actually realise what silent tears were. But the funny part is that i think these 2 weeks were the best weeks i have had at srishti. Yes there were times that i wanted to smash my head into the computer just because of a wrong capital letter and yes i wanted to go home and sleep and not do the mountain of assignments Arvind assigned us to do but even after all this i feel like i have learnt a core skill which i enjoy and which i would pusue and develop over the years. Just the process of finding the perfect graph after failing at it for a thousand times and the satisfaction of seeing that little red line turn green over a piece of code when i figured out an error is uncomparable. I might be terrible at it right now but i am certain that i will keep practicing and sharpening my skill of this disastrous yet wonderful language of R._


**Well anyways here are some graphs that i consider to be my best works:**


## Graph 1

This Graph is representing data from the diamonds dataset. It shows us the relantionship between price and carat through a line graph and also shows us the quality of the cut of the diamond with respect to the price and cut.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() +theme_bw() + labs(title="Scatterplot line graph")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}

banned_items <- read.csv(file = "banned_items.csv")

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
b99_edges <- read_delim("b99_edges.csv", delim = ",")
b99_nodes <- read_delim("b99_nodes.csv", delim = ",")
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
drop_na(b99_nodes)
drop_na(b99_edges) %>% 
  kable()

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
b99 <- tbl_graph(nodes = b99_nodes, 
                edges = b99_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
```


### Graph 2

This graph was done on the show brooklyn "NINETY NINE" and it shows the duration of time characters interacted with each other, what they talked about and their proffession. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggraph(b99, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_arc(aes(width = duration, color =topic), alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 2)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color =profession, size = 2)) + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = Names),repel = TRUE, 
                 size = 3,
                 max.overlaps = 20) +
  labs(edge_width = "duration") +
  
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        aspect.ratio = 1)
```











```{r, include=FALSE}
airlines_nodes <- read_delim("data/AIRLINES-NODES (1).csv",delim = ';')
airlines_edges <- read_delim("data/AIRLINES-EDGES (1).csv",delim = ';')

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
airline2 <- airlines_nodes %>% select(latitude, longitude) %>% transmute(Latitude = latitude / 1000000, Longitude = longitude / 1000000)
           
airline2


```


## Graph 3

This graph shows the frequency of arrivals and departures of flights in the USA.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_layout <- cbind(x = airline2$Longitude, y = airline2$Latitude) %>% as.matrix()
g <- tbl_graph(nodes = airlines_nodes, edges = airlines_edges)
ggraph(g, layout = my_layout) + geom_edge_link0(alpha = 0.3) + geom_node_point(aes(color = Code), shape = 21, size = 1, stroke = 2) + theme(legend.position = "none")

```
