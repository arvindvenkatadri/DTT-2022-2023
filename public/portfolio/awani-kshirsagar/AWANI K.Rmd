## **Graph 1**

```{r read csv}
pura <- read_csv("pura.csv")

pura
```


```{r}
data("World")
World
india <- World %>% filter(iso_a3 == "IND")
crs_india <- st_crs(india)


pura <- # Create 5 random points
  
#str(points) 
# Convert to spatial data frame
pura_sf <- st_as_sf(pura,
         coords = c("LNG.", "LAT."),
           crs = crs_india)
#str(points_sf)
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = india) +
    geom_sf(data = pura_sf, colour = "purple", size = 3) +
ggtitle("Purs and Puras in India")



#Plotting with tmap
tm_shape(india) +
  tm_borders(col = "black", lwd = 1) +
  
  tm_shape(pura_sf) +
  tm_dots(col = "STATE",size= 0.5, legend.show = FALSE)+
  tm_graticules()+
  tm_add_legend(type="symbol", col = "purple",title = "Color wise seperation of pur/pura")+
  tm_scale_bar(position=c("left","bottom"), text.size = 1.5)+
  tm_compass(position = c("right","top"),type="rose",size=1.5)+
  tm_credits(text= "Awani",
             position = c("left","bottom"))+
  tm_layout(main.title = "Pur, Puras by color",
            bg.color = "yellow")



```



Understanding how to plot this graph was a bit tough for me, but when I figured it out, it was smooth sailing. The graph shows that towns ending with 'pur' or 'pura' are **pretty uniform** all across India, with the exception of the north- eastern parts.



## **Graph 2**


```{r}
data("karate",package= "igraphdata")
karate
```

```{r}
karate_tbl <- as_tbl_graph(karate)
karate_tbl
```


```{r}
karate %>% as_tbl_graph() %>% activate(edges) %>% as_tibble

```

```{r}
karate %>% as_tbl_graph() %>% activate(nodes) %>% as_tibble
```

```{r}
ggraph(karate_tbl)+ geom_edge_link0() + geom_node_point()+ geom_edge_link(width = 1, 
                 color = "blue") +geom_node_point(
    shape = 21,
    size = 4,
    fill = "pink",
    color = "yellow",
    stroke = 1.5
  ) + ggtitle("Zachary Karate Club Networks")


```

From this somewhat **messy graph**, we can see that many actors had close relations with many others, leading to the messy situation that followed.

## **Graph 3**


```{r}
diamonds %>% head()
diamonds %>% tail()
diamonds %>% dim()

```








```{r Single_Cat_Var_Calculations}
diamonds %>% count(carat)
diamonds %>% count(cut)
diamonds %>% count(color)
diamonds %>% count(clarity)
diamonds %>% count(depth)
diamonds %>% count(table)
diamonds %>% count(price)


```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + geom_bar(aes(y = carat,
                                fill = price,
                                color = cut), 
                            position = "stack") + scale_color_viridis_d(option = "inferno")
```

This **Bar graph** compares the diamonds in terms of their carat and price with respect to cut.

This graph was insightful and beautiful.


## Conclusion
This class was my best class in Srishti so far. Every day was fun, learning more about the fascinating world of RStudio. Having an amazing facilitator certainly played a big part in my increasing enthusiasm for coding in RStudio. **Although workshop is over, my journey with R has just begun :)**
