<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Oh my what a rollercoaster were these 2 weeks were, lots of suffering and internal pain, the course made me actually realise what silent tears were. But the funny part is that i think these 2 weeks were the best weeks i have had at srishti. Yes there were times that i wanted to smash my head into the computer just because of a wrong capital letter and yes i wanted to go home and sleep and not do the mountain of assignments Arvind assigned us to do but even after all this i feel like i have learnt a core skill which i enjoy and which i would pusue and develop over the years. Just the process of finding the perfect graph after failing at it for a thousand times and the satisfaction of seeing that little red line turn green over a piece of code when i figured out an error is uncomparable. I might be terrible at it right now but i am certain that i will keep practicing and sharpening my skill of this disastrous yet wonderful language of R._</p>
<p><strong>Well anyways here are some graphs that i consider to be my best works:</strong></p>

<h2>Graph 1</h2>
<p>This Graph is representing data from the diamonds dataset. It shows us the relantionship between price and carat through a line graph and also shows us the quality of the cut of the diamond with respect to the price and cut.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() +theme_bw() + labs(title=&quot;Scatterplot line graph&quot;)</code></pre>

<h3>Graph 2</h3>
<p>This graph was done on the show brooklyn “NINETY NINE” and it shows the duration of time characters interacted with each other, what they talked about and their proffession.</p>
