Hi! I am Arunima Sajith. I'm someone who had never even thought to learn coding before this class. And within two weeks of this workshop I think I've grown significantly. These are some of my favorite pieces of work I've made during this time period.

Plotting the price of diamonds against density. I love the colors in this one (it took me hours to get.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + geom_density(aes(x = price, fill = cut)) + labs(title = "Price vs Density") + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma")

```




```{r, eval=FALSE, include = FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Relationship analysis of characters in the TV show Fleabag. (Note: the dataset was made based only on S2E1)
# 
ggraph(graph = fb, layout = "circle") +
  
  
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Intensity), colour= "antiquewhite3")  + scale_edge_width(range = c(0, 3)) +
  
  
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = Relationship), shape = 23,
                      size = 5.5,
                      stroke = 2 ) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = Name), repel = TRUE, color = "black")+
  
  
  labs(title = "Intensity")
```

Restaurants in my hometown mapped according to cuisine and location.

```{r}
buildings <- st_read("data/buildings.gpkg")
parks <- st_read("data/parks.gpkg")
greenery <- st_read("data/greenery.gpkg")
trees <- st_read("data/trees.gpkg")
roads <- st_read("data/roads.gpkg")
restaurants <- st_read("data/restaurants.gpkg") # Added by Arvind
```


```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = buildings, colour = "burlywood1") +
  geom_sf(data = roads, colour = "darkred") +
  geom_sf(data = trees, colour = "darkgreen") +
  geom_sf(
    data = restaurants %>% drop_na(cuisine), # dat_R removed by Arvind
    aes(fill = cuisine),
    colour = "brown",
    shape = 21,
    size = 4) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(title = "Restaurants in North Central Kerala",
       caption = "i recommend paragon biriyani")
```




#### **CONCLUSION & THANKS**

##### RStudio is not easy to work with when you're a beginner. But I think the environment we were in and the facilitator we had made it a lot easier for us to get a grip on things. Most of my days were filled with cries for help from around the class but it didn't match the satisfaction I felt when a code I typed gave me a result in the end. I'm very grateful to this class for broadening my horizons on what I consider art and helping me grow as a student.
