<p>Hello Hello! I’m swapnali &lt;3 and you are watch the disne… haha just kidding XD

<h2>Graph 1</h2>
<p>This box plot shows the <em>final weight distribution</em> of all the chicken from the chickenwheight dataset according to their diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>the data set was about 50 chicken consuming 4 different types of diet</li>
<li>the weight of these chicken was recorded over time</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Diet, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Diet)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Diet&quot;, y = &quot;weight(g)&quot;, title =&quot;Final weight distribution&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/chicken.png" />
<strong><em>Bold line</em></strong> inside the box represents the <strong>median weight</strong> of chicken in each type of diet</p>

<p>This map shows <strong><em>some</em></strong> villages in india who have ‘pur or pura’ in their names
The villages light up like diyas on the night map .
I would encourage you to hover over the points, zoom into the states for funzies!</p>

<p>I am extremely proud of this map and i would have given up if it weren’t for arvind giving me an ultimatum of not accepting my A3 till i figure out how to code it.</p>

<h2>My Course Reflection</h2>
<p>I distinctly remember arvid saying we our hunter gatherers with laptops on our second day into the workshop. On my last day here,after spending 2 hours on how to make my map in Diwali theme, i can defiantly agree to it.</p>
<p>I have noticed that many people have prejudices around coding, about how its absolutely nerdy and boring. Since i had little experience with coding prior (it was just sql and some python haha nothing serious) i was really excited to code. while sometimes it does get frustrating, successfully knitting the code into life brought me so much joy every single time.</p>
<p>this course and especially arvind, got me inspired and made me look forward to code more. i realized after my final map about how much joy making maps gives me.</p>
<p>overall i feel like i learnt a lot in this workshop and i look forward to be able to do this more and apply it in my work</p>
